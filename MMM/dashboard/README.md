# Data Challenge UAS â€” Product A Sales Prediction Dashboard

This repository contains the code and materials used to build an interactive dashboard as part of the Data Challenge UAS project. The project focuses on forecasting sales of skincare products from Manufacturer A using a Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) approach combined with machine learning.

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Our partner is looking to predict product A's sales based on several influencing variables, including:
1. Advertising intensity (GRP)
2. Competitor activity
3. Day type (weekday/weekend)
4. Store-level sales distribution

This project delivers a machine learning-based predictive model and a Streamlit-powered interactive dashboard that allows users to simulate sales by selecting a specific date and adjusting relevant input values.

# ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features
1. Date selection for prediction
2. Predicted number of product A units sold
